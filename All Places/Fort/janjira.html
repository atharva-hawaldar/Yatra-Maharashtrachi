                <h1>Murud‑Janjira Fort</h1>
                <p>
                    is a majestic sea fortress perched on an oval rock just off the shore of Murud, rising above the
                    Arabian Sea with its imposing black‑granite ramparts and 26 artillery towers. Initially a humble
                    wooden structure built by fishermen in the 15th century, it was fortified into a stone stronghold by
                    Malik Ambar in 1567, later becoming an unbeatable bastion under the ruling Siddis. Notable for its
                    massive cannons—Kalal Baangadi, Chavri, and Landa Kasam—the fort’s defences were never breached by
                    the Marathas, Mughals, Portuguese, or British. Entry is via a narrow main gate facing Rajpuri, with
                    a secret sea gate (“Darya Darwaza”) for emergency escape. Inside are remnants of a royal palace,
                    mosque, officers’ quarters, stables, granaries, and impressive freshwater ponds over 60 feet
                    deep—remarkable for an island fort. Visitors board a boat from Rajpuri jetty (operational between
                    7 AM–12 PM and 2–4:45 PM), with no entry fee and boat fares around ₹20–500 depending on boat size.
                    The fort is open 7 AM–6 PM, making October to March the ideal season for a calm, enriching visit.
                    After exploring the fort, travelers can enjoy nearby Murud Beach, marvel at Garambi Falls and
                    Ahmedganj Palace, trek to Kasa Fort, visit the lush Phansad Sanctuary, or explore ancient Kuda Caves
                    and vibrant Kashid Beach. With its dramatic sea setting, resilient architecture, and serene
                    surroundings, Murud‑Janjira offers a captivating blend of history, adventure, and coastal beauty.
