                <h1>TORANA FORT</h1>
                <p>
                    Torna Fort, also known historically as Prachandagad, soars to 1,403 m above sea level, making it
                    Pune district’s highest hill-fort. Situated roughly 60 km from Pune, the trek begins from the base
                    village of Velhe, you can spot the majestic fort from the start. The ascent covers 2–3 km of mixed
                    terrain, including a steep ridge where ladders and railings guide trekkers through rocky patches. On
                    the way up, monsoon-season visitors are treated to vibrant wildflowers and occasional streams. It
                    typically takes about three hours to reach the summit, where explorers can spend another 3–4 hours
                    wandering through historical relics such as Budhla Machi, Zunjar Machi, Bini and Kothi Darwajas, and
                    the Menghai Devi Temple nestled amidst the ruins. The panorama from the top encompasses numerous
                    other forts, including Rajgad and Raigad. Trekkers should set out between July and September to
                    experience lush greenery, or from November to February for crisp skies and cooler temperatures.
                    Logistics are straightforward: Velhe offers basic food stalls, though there is no potable water on
                    the fort—carry at least three liters. Emergency support is available via local health and rescue
                    teams, but mobile signal is patchy beyond the base. Overall, Torna Fort offers a fulfilling blend of
                    physical challenge, rich history, and breathtaking natural beauty—ideal for seasoned adventurers and
                    fit beginners alike.
