                <h1>PENCH NATIONAL PARK </h1>
                <p>
                    Pench National Park, straddling the border of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, is one of India’s most
                    celebrated tiger reserves, known for its rich biodiversity and its inspiration for Rudyard Kipling’s
                    classic, The Jungle Book. Officially established as a wildlife sanctuary in 1965 and declared a
                    national park in 1975, Pench gained further recognition when it was designated a tiger reserve in
                    1992 under India’s Project Tiger. The park covers a total area of approximately 758 square
                    kilometers, with about 257 square kilometers forming the core zone and the rest as buffer areas
                    spread across both states.<br>
                    The park’s landscape is a picturesque blend of undulating hills, dense teak forests, open
                    grasslands, and meandering streams, with the Pench River, from which the park gets its name, flowing
                    right through its heart. The river and its seasonal tributaries are lifelines that sustain the
                    diverse flora and fauna throughout the year. The ecosystem here supports a rich variety of wildlife,
                    making it one of the most ecologically balanced parks in central India.<br>
                    Pench National Park is best known for its thriving tiger population. It is home to an estimated
                    50-60 tigers, along with a healthy population of other predators such as leopards, wild dogs
                    (dholes), jungle cats, and hyenas. The park is equally renowned for its herbivore population,
                    including large herds of chital (spotted deer), sambar, nilgai, and gaur (Indian bison), all of
                    which support the predator-prey dynamic of the forest. The presence of the majestic Indian leopard
                    adds an extra thrill to wildlife safaris.The park is also a birdwatcher’s paradise, boasting over
                    250 species of resident and migratory birds, including peafowls, hornbills, crested serpent eagles,
                    and various species of kingfishers, storks, and waterfowl that thrive around the riverbanks and
                    forest clearings. Reptiles, insects, and smaller mammals like civets and palm squirrels contribute
                    to the park’s complex food web.
