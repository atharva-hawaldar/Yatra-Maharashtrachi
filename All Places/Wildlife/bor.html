                <h1>BOR TIGER RESERVE </h1>
                <p>
                    Bor Tiger Reserve, ocated near Hingani village in Wardha district, Maharashtra, is a lesser-known
                    but ecologically rich wildlife sanctuary that offers a peaceful and uncrowded alternative to the
                    more famous tiger reserves of central India. Spread across an area of approximately 138 square
                    kilometers, Bor was officially declared a tiger reserve in 2014, becoming one of the newer additions
                    to India’s Project Tiger network. The reserve is part of the Satpura-Maikal tiger landscape, serving
                    as an important wildlife corridor that connects major tiger habitats like Pench, Melghat, and
                    Tadoba.<br>
                    The reserve’s core area, about 61 square kilometers, is dense and biologically significant, while
                    the buffer zones provide critical support for both wildlife and nearby human settlements. Bor’s
                    landscape features a harmonious mix of dry deciduous forests, grasslands, rocky outcrops, and the
                    prominent Bor Reservoir, which serves as a vital water source for both animals and surrounding
                    communities.<br>
                    Although smaller than many other tiger reserves, Bor is known for its high tiger density relative to
                    its size. Tigers frequently move between Bor and neighboring sanctuaries, contributing to genetic
                    diversity and population stability in the region. In addition to tigers, Bor Tiger Reserve is home
                    to leopards, sloth bears, wild boars, Indian bison (gaur), nilgai, chital, sambar, barking deer, and
                    langurs.
                    Bor is also a delight for birdwatchers and nature enthusiasts, with more than 160 recorded species
                    of birds, including the Indian roller, crested serpent eagle, kingfishers, bee-eaters, and various
                    species of storks and herons that thrive around the reservoir and forest clearings. The calm waters
                    of the Bor Dam attract many migratory birds in the winter, making it a seasonal hotspot for bird
                    photography.
