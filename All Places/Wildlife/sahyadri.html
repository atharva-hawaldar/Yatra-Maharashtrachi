                <h1>Sahyadri Tiger Reserve </h1>
                <p>
                    Sahyadri Tiger Reserve is a vast and ecologically vital protected area located in the Western Ghats
                    of Maharashtra, covering parts of Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, and Ratnagiri districts. Established in
                    2007 under India’s Project Tiger initiative, it spans approximately 1,165 square kilometers with
                    about 600 square kilometers of core zone and the remaining area designated as a buffer. The reserve
                    includes two major sanctuaries: Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary and Chandoli National Park, making it one
                    of the largest contiguous forest stretches in the Western Ghats.
                    What sets Sahyadri Tiger Reserve apart is its rugged terrain of high-altitude mountains, deep
                    valleys, rivers, dense forests, and plateaus that create an extraordinary variety of habitats. The
                    forest type is primarily semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, and evergreen patches, interspersed with
                    grasslands and rocky cliffs. The sanctuary’s position in the Sahyadri hill ranges provides essential
                    connectivity for tiger movements between Maharashtra, Goa, and Karnataka.
                    Although the tiger population in Sahyadri is currently low compared to other reserves, it is a
                    crucial tiger corridor and supports a small but significant population of tigers, Indian leopards,
                    sloth bears, wild boars, sambar, barking deer, Indian bison (gaur), and giant squirrels. Camera
                    traps have confirmed the presence of tigers, indicating that the region is gradually re-establishing
                    itself as a secure tiger habitat.<br>
                    The reserve is equally important for avian and reptilian diversity. It hosts over 230 species of
                    birds, including the Malabar grey hornbill, crested serpent eagle, Indian paradise flycatcher, and
                    various species of woodpeckers and sunbirds. The dense forests and wet areas also provide ideal
                    conditions for amphibians and reptiles, many of which are endemic to the Western Ghats.The Koyna
                    River and the massive Shivsagar Lake play a critical role in maintaining the sanctuary’s ecosystem,
                    offering year-round water sources for wildlife. The region’s high rainfall (due to the monsoon winds
                    hitting the Western Ghats) ensures that the forests remain green and rich in vegetation for most of
                    the year.
