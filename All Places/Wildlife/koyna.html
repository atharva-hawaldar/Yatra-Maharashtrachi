                <h1>Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary </h1>
                <p>
                    Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary is a pristine and ecologically significant protected area located in the
                    Satara district of Maharashtra, about 190 kilometers from Pune and roughly 65 kilometers from
                    Mahabaleshwar. Spread over an expansive area of approximately 423 square kilometers, the sanctuary
                    forms an integral part of the Western Ghats, which are globally recognized as a UNESCO World Natural
                    Heritage Site and one of the world’s eight "hottest hotspots" of biological diversity.<br>
                    The sanctuary is named after the Koyna River, which flows majestically through its landscape,
                    creating the massive Shivsagar Lake — one of the largest water reservoirs in Maharashtra. The
                    terrain is a beautiful mix of thick evergreen forests, semi-evergreen patches, grasslands, valleys,
                    and hills that reach elevations up to 1,100 meters. The region’s high rainfall and rich soil
                    contribute to its lush vegetation and thriving biodiversity.<br>
                    Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary is a key tiger habitat, though sightings are rare due to the dense forests
                    and the secretive nature of the tigers in this region. Apart from tigers, the sanctuary is home to
                    Indian leopards, sloth bears, sambar deer, barking deer, Indian bison (gaur), wild boars, giant
                    squirrels, and langurs. The forests also support several smaller mammals, reptiles, and amphibians,
                    making it a crucial wildlife corridor that connects other sanctuaries like Chandoli and Radhanagari.
                    The sanctuary is a paradise for birdwatchers and herpetologists, boasting over 250 species of birds
                    including the Malabar pied hornbill, crested serpent eagle, grey jungle fowl, and various species of
                    woodpeckers, kingfishers, and migratory birds that frequent the lake areas. The region is also known
                    for its diverse population of snakes and frogs, many of which are endemic to the Western Ghats.
