                <h1>The Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary </h1>
                <p>
                    The Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary is a pristine ecological haven
                    located in the Sahyadri Hills of the Western Ghats, about 120 kilometers from Pune and 220
                    kilometers from Mumbai. Established in 1984, the sanctuary was specifically created to protect the
                    habitat of the endangered species Indian Giant Squirrel (Shekru), which is also the state animal of
                    Maharashtra. Spanning an area of approximately 131 square kilometers, the sanctuary is a crucial
                    part of the Western Ghats, which is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the eight
                    "hottest hotspots" of biological diversity in the world.<br>
                    The sanctuary is a rich mosaic of evergreen forests, semi-evergreen woods, and grasslands, offering
                    shelter to a wide variety of plant and animal species. It is home to over 275 species of birds,
                    including the Malabar whistling thrush, grey jungle fowl, and several species of hornbills. Apart
                    from the famous Shekru, the forest supports mammals like leopards, wild boars, barking deer, sambar,
                    langurs, and a variety of smaller carnivores and reptiles.
                    The sanctuary is especially popular among birdwatchers, wildlife photographers, trekkers, and nature
                    lovers due to its exceptional biodiversity. The monsoon and post-monsoon seasons (June to February)
                    transform the sanctuary into a lush green paradise, with seasonal waterfalls, dense mist, and a
                    symphony of bird calls creating a magical atmosphere. Treks like the Bhimashankar Trek via Shidi
                    Ghat and Ganesh Ghat are famous routes that pass through thick forests, offering challenging climbs
                    and stunning panoramic views.<br>
                    At the heart of the sanctuary is the sacred Bhimashankar Temple, one of the twelve Jyotirlingas of
                    Lord Shiva, which draws thousands of pilgrims throughout the year. The combination of religious
                    devotion and ecological richness makes the sanctuary a unique blend of spiritual and natural
                    heritage.<br>
                    The Bhimashankar region is also the origin of the Bhima River, one of the important rivers flowing
                    through Maharashtra.
