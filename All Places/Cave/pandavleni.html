                <h1>Pandavleni Caves</h1>
                <p>
                    Pandavleni Caves,Carved into the rugged slopes of Trirashmi Hill, about 8 km southwest of Nashik,
                    the Pandavleni Caves are a collection of around 24 rock-cut sanctuaries that span from the 1st
                    century BCE to the 3rd century CE, with further additions extending up to the 6th century CE. These
                    caves primarily represent the Hinayana phase of Buddhism, focusing on simplicity, meditation spaces,
                    and community living rather than elaborate iconography. The most prominent among them is Cave 3
                    (Gautamiputra Vihara), commissioned by Queen Gautami Balasiri, mother of the renowned Satavahana
                    ruler Gautamiputra Satakarni around 150 CE. This grand vihara features spacious assembly halls,
                    stone benches, intricately carved doorways, and detailed Brahmi inscriptions that shed light on the
                    patronage of merchants, monks, and Satavahana rulers. These inscriptions not only mention
                    significant political figures but also reveal the active participation of local trading guilds and
                    spiritual communities in the site's development.<br>
                    Cave 18 stands out as the sole chaitya-griha within the complex, housing a carefully crafted stupa
                    and supported by elegantly carved pillars with chaitya-arch motifs, which showcase the devotional
                    architectural style of early Buddhist worship. The caves’ advanced rock-cut cisterns and
                    water-harvesting systems are a testament to the remarkable engineering skills of the period,
                    ensuring a steady water supply even during dry seasons, which was essential for sustaining the
                    monastic life at this remote hilltop retreat. Positioned high above the surrounding plains, the
                    caves offer panoramic views of Nashik city and the Godavari river valley, creating an atmosphere of
                    peace, isolation, and spiritual elevation.
