                <h1>Ellora Caves</h1>
                <p>
                    The Ellora CavesSprawling across 2 km of basalt cliffs near Aurangabad, the Ellora Caves complex is
                    a breathtaking fusion of art, religion, and architecture, comprising 34 rock-cut caves that were
                    excavated over several centuries. These include 12 Buddhist caves dating from approximately 200 BCE
                    to 600 CE, 17 Hindu caves carved between 500–900 CE, and 5 Jain caves completed around 800–1000 CE.
                    These magnificent structures were patronized by several powerful dynasties including the Chalukyas,
                    Rashtrakutas, and Yadavas, reflecting a rich cultural and religious legacy.<br>
                    The crowning glory of Ellora is the Kailasa Temple (Cave 16), a monumental achievement of rock-cut
                    engineering and artistry, believed to have been commissioned in the 8th century CE by Rashtrakuta
                    king Krishna I. The temple was carved directly downward from solid basalt rock, with an estimated
                    150,000 to 200,000 tons of stone removed in the process. Rising nearly 30 meters high and covering a
                    footprint of approximately 50 meters by 33 meters, the temple resembles a freestanding multi-storey
                    Dravidian temple complex complete with intricately carved pillared halls, towering gopurams,
                    spacious courtyards, and grand sculptures. Scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata are meticulously
                    etched into the walls, including vivid depictions such as Vishnu’s Narasimha avatar (man-lion form),
                    Ravana shaking Mount Kailash in a show of might, and the sacred Nandi bull patiently watching over
                    Shiva’s abode.<br>
                    Among the Buddhist caves, Cave 10 (Vishvakarma Cave) stands out with its elegant vaulted chaitya
                    hall, ribbed ceilings that mimic wooden beams, and a serene seated Buddha presiding over the
                    sanctuary.
                    The journey to the caves begins with a scenic 1-hour ferry ride from Mumbai’s Gateway of India,
                    followed by a climb of approximately 120 steps flanked by stalls selling local handicrafts.
