                <h1>Karla Caves</h1>
                <p>
                    Karla CavesKarla Caves, located near the village of Karla, about 11 kilometers from Lonavala in
                    Maharashtra, India, are among the oldest and most remarkable examples of early Buddhist rock-cut
                    architecture. These caves were primarily excavated between the 2nd century BCE and the 5th century
                    CE. They served as important religious and rest stops along the ancient trade routes connecting the
                    Arabian Sea to the Deccan Plateau. The Karla Caves complex is especially famous for its magnificent
                    Great Chaitya Hall (Cave 8), which is considered the largest and best-preserved chaitya (prayer
                    hall) in India. This hall is about 45 meters long and 14 meters high and features a beautifully
                    vaulted wooden ribbed roof, which closely resembles earlier wooden structures, a rare surviving
                    example of this style. The entrance to the chaitya has an impressive stone façade with a large
                    arched window and one surviving grand pillar topped with four lions, similar to the famous lion
                    capitals from the Mauryan period.<br>
                    <br>
                    The caves reflect the early Hinayana (Theravada) Buddhist tradition, as they do not feature Buddha
                    statues in the original construction but instead focus on stupas as the central object of worship.
                    Over time, some Mahayana influences also became visible. These caves were supported and funded by
                    local merchants, traders, and rulers, including the Western Satraps and Satavahana kings. Notably,
                    inscriptions mention donations from Yavana (Greek) traders, showing the cross-cultural connections
                    of that period. The location, religious significance, and architectural brilliance of the Karla
                    Caves make them a vital part of India's ancient cultural and spiritual heritage.
