                <h1>Bordi Dahanu BeachStretching</h1>
                <p>Bordi Dahanu BeachStretching along Maharashtra’s Palghar coastline, about 145 km north of Mumbai, the
                    Bordi–Dahanu corridor offers a nearly 6 km expanse of soft, golden sand, bordered by lush chikoo
                    (sapodilla) orchards that give the region its unique agro-coastal charm. This seaside agrarian
                    landscape is dotted with quaint villages and tranquil farm lanes, making it a peaceful retreat away
                    from the bustle.
                    Getting There & Access: The region is accessible by Western Railway (Bordi Road & Dahanu Road
                    stations) or state buses from Mumbai and Thane. Last-mile travel includes shared autos or
                    rickshaws—beach drop-offs can get you directly to the dunes and orchards, though some homestays may
                    require a short walk.
                    Accommodation & Local Living: Options include elegant farm stays nestled in chikoo groves, restored
                    heritage Parsi homes transformed into guesthouses, and budget beach lodges. Many hosts serve
                    homemade chikoo-based dishes—smoothies, ice creams, and baked delights—as well as fresh
                    catch-of-the-day meals seasoned with regional spices.
                    Activities & Exploration:<br>
                    1.Chikoo Orchard Tours during the January Dahanu Chikoo Festival, where visitors can pick fruit,
                    stroll through orchards, and enjoy local performances.<br>
                    2.Farm-to-table experiences, with orchard owners demonstrating fruit processing and offering
                    seasonal tasting sessions.<br>
                    3.Beachside leisure, perfect for sunrise walks, shell collecting, or gentle horse-cart rides through
                    palm and orchard-lined lanes.<br>
                    4.Adventure options like paragliding (seasonal), cycling through village paths, and local artwalks
                    showcasing Warli/Rajasthani-inspired Parsi painting on home facades. </p>
