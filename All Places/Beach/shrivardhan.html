                <h1>Shrivardhan beach</h1>
                <p>,Shrivardhan BeachLocated in Raigad district, approximately 180 km from Pune, Shrivardhan Beach is a
                    serene, gently curving black-sand shoreline that extends over a kilometer, framed by casuarina trees
                    and historic temples. This coastal town is steeped in Peshwa-era heritage, with the centuries-old
                    Shrivardhan Ganesh Temple and surrounding shrines offering a spiritual dimension to your beach
                    visit. <br>
                    The calm waters and smooth sands make it ideal for family outings, peaceful walks, and light
                    swimming.
                    Reaching Shrivardhan is convenient via coastal roads or well-connected state buses and private
                    vehicles from Pune and Mumbai.<br>
                    Accommodation includes charming heritage guesthouses, modest beach retreats, and coastal
                    homestays—all serving Konkani delicacies; don’t miss the fresh pomfret fry, bangda (mackerel), and
                    homemade sol kadhi. Beyond the beach, visitors can rent boats for estuary tours, cycle through
                    nearby fishing villages, and explore local creeks dotted with watertolerant trees.
                    Best visited from November to February, when the weather is pleasant and evenings are cool, though
                    the monsoon months (June to September) turn the surrounding Sahyadri foothills a lush green, with
                    soothing rains. Evening beach walks with a light sweater are highly recommended. Guests should carry
                    comfortable walking shoes, a power bank, and modest swimwear, and be aware that electricity supply
                    in smaller stays may be unpredictable.
