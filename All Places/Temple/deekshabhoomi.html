                <p>
                    DeekshabhoomiTemple
                    Deekshabhoomi is one of the most important Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India, located in Nagpur,
                    Maharashtra. It holds profound historical and spiritual significance as the place where Dr. B. R.
                    Ambedkar, the principal architect of the Indian Constitution and a revered social reformer,
                    converted to Buddhism on 14 October 1956 along with over half a million followers. This mass
                    conversion marked the beginning of the Navayana (Neo-Buddhist) movement in India, making
                    Deekshabhoomi a symbol of social transformation, equality, and liberation from caste-based
                    discrimination.<br>
                    At the heart of Deekshabhoomi stands a massive white stupa, designed in a modern architectural style
                    while deeply rooted in Buddhist symbolism. The stupa is one of the largest of its kind in Asia, with
                    a vast central dome that houses a sacred bronze statue of Lord Buddha and relics believed to be
                    associated with the Buddha’s lineage. The interior of the stupa is spacious, with polished marble
                    floors and high ceilings that create a tranquil atmosphere for prayer, meditation, and reflection.
                    The site also features surrounding pathways, lush green lawns, and additional halls for gatherings
                    and sermons.<br>
                    The stupa’s design emphasizes openness and inclusion, symbolizing Dr. Ambedkar’s vision of a society
                    free from inequality. Engraved on the walls are inscriptions of the Twenty-Two Vows that Dr.
                    Ambedkar administered to his followers, marking their commitment to Buddhist principles and the
                    rejection of caste hierarchy.
                    Deekshabhoomi is not just a monument; it is a living center of learning and community service. The
                    complex includes a library dedicated to Buddhist literature, a museum showcasing Dr. Ambedkar’s life
                    and the history of Buddhism, and spaces for educational and cultural programs. Visitors can attend
                    regular Dhamma talks, prayer sessions, and social gatherings that promote the teachings of the
                    Buddha and Dr. Ambedkar’s message of equality.
